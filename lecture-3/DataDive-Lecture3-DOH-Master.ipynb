    "\n",
    "[This dataset](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j) provides restaurant inspections, violations, grades and adjudication information. It is freely available through the NYC Open Data portal, though for the purposes of this exercise we'll be using a static version I pulled in early September 2018 that is available at the url below. A Data Dictionary is available [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/43nn-pn8j/files/e3160d37-1b15-41ef-af6b-a830ed39cbc0?download=true&filename=Restaurant_Inspection_Open_Data_Dictionary_082214.xlsx). \n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this exercise, we'll be drawing on skills highlighted in the [DataCamp course](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/cleaning-data-in-python), as well as miscellaneous other commands I've introduced in the first two classes. [Ten Minutes to Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html) is a great reference for these. \n",
