    "The New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC), created in 1971, is the agency responsible for licensing and regulating New York City's Medallion (Yellow) taxi cabs, for-hire vehicles (community-based liveries, black cars and luxury limousines), commuter vans, and paratransit vehicles. The Commission's Board consists of nine members, eight of whom are unsalaried Commissioners. The salaried Chair/ Commissioner presides over regularly scheduled public commission meetings and is the head of the agency, which maintains a staff of approximately 600 TLC employees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over 200,000 TLC licensees complete approximately 1,000,000 trips each day. To operate for hire, drivers must first undergo a background check, have a safe driving record, and complete 24 hours of driver training. TLC-licensed vehicles are inspected for safety and emissions at TLC's Woodside Inspection Facility.\n",
    "\n",
    "*** \n",
    "TLC Data has spawned an enormous amount coding challenges on Kaggle (including [this](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration) and [this](https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction)), cool interactive visualizations like [this one](http://chriswhong.github.io/nyctaxi/), and has been known to pop on coding challenges given out by firms hiring data scientists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we'll try to calculate the likelihood of ending a trip in a given area of the city given a certain starting point. With roughly 8 million trip records per month, we'll have to think carefully about how we process our data and scale our analysis.    \n"
